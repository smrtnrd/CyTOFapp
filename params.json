The main functions that CytFOF provides are:\r\n\r\n1. It performs a nonlinear dimensionality reduction on the high-dimensional single-cell data and obtains the inferred low-dimensional representation.\r\n2. The low dimensional data can be visualized.\r\n3. It provides filtering, gating and normalisation methods to preprocess the data.\r\n\r\n## To Run\r\n\r\n```s\r\nshiny::runGitHub(\"CyTOFapp\", \"smrtnrd\", launch.browser=TRUE)\r\n```\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
