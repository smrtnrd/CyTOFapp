# CyTOFapp test

CytFOF is web application for preprocessing and analysis of high-dimensional single-cell data such as that generated by Mass Cytometry (CyTOFTM, Fluidigm Corp.). The main functions that CytFOF provides are:

1. It performs a nonlinear dimensionality reduction on the high-dimensional single-cell data and obtains the inferred low-dimensional representation.
2. The low dimensional data can be visualized.
3. It provides clustering and gating methods to automate the classification of cellular sub-populations.
